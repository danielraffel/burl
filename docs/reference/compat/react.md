# React compat

Reserved for React-specific features that aren't single-prop entries:
Suspense, ConcurrentMode, Profiler, error boundaries, refs, portals,
hooks edge cases (`useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, `useId`,
`useSyncExternalStore`).

The single-prop surface (`fontSize`, `border`, `data`, etc.) is
captured under [`rn`](rn.md), which mirrors what
`packages/pulp-react/src/prop-applier.ts` actually dispatches.

## Generation

Last refresh: **2026-05-04** against `origin/main` at SHA `a5f4f5ac`.

## Status

The renderer is built on React 19 and `react-reconciler@0.31` and
supports the basic function-component + `useState` + `useEffect` +
`useRef` + `useMemo` / `useCallback` set; concurrent features are not
exercised. The host supplies React 19's commit-suspension and host-transition
hooks as explicit no-ops because native Burl widgets have no browser resource
preload phase. Public `render()` and native-event state updates retain their
legacy synchronous bridge-mutation behavior.

Platform hosts deliver global key events through the core view
script-events hook when `pulp::view-script` is linked. `WidgetBridge`
registers the React/runtime fan-out from the keyboard-input translation
unit, so `window.addEventListener('keydown', ...)` and
`registerShortcut(...)` continue to work for React apps without forcing
core-only `pulp::view-core` consumers to link the JS runtime.

The renderer exposes a typed `<VirtualList>` intrinsic for large rich-row
lists. It lowers to the native `VirtualList` widget, keeps a bounded recycled
row pool, and routes `rowCount`, fixed `rowHeight`, `overscan`,
`selectionMode`, `selected`, `scrollToRow`, and `renderRow` through the
bridge. Lowercase `virtual-list` / `virtuallist` DOM tags reach the same native
widget for web-compat consumers.

Follow-up: enumerate observed React features (concurrent rendering,
suspense boundaries, transition state, error boundaries, portal
targets) and populate per-feature entries.
